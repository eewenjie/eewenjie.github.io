Dr. Zhang's research interests focus on explainable and trustworthy AI and its applications in smart grids, with a broad scope encompassing big data analytics and multimodal learning. He has secured more than seven internal industrial funding as the principal investigator in companies and served as a principal researcher in four national research projects supported by government agencies such as the Energy Market Authority in Singapore and AI@SG.

***Position Openings***

Along with [Prof. Chung Chi-Yung](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ee/people/academic-staff/prof-cy-chung/) (Fellow of Canadian Academy of Engineering, IEEE, EIC, IET, and HKIE), Dr. Zhang is recruiting multiple postdoctoral fellows, research associates, and Ph.D. students as part of the Research Centre for Grid Modernization. The targeted research areas include, but are not limited to:
1.	AI-based grid digitalization and renewable integration
2.	Multimodal learning for defect/fault detection in smart grids
3.	Big data-based energy policy analysis.

Potential applicants are cordially invited to reach out to Dr. Zhang at [wenjie-ee.zhang[at]polyu.edu.hk](mailto:wenjie-ee.zhang@polyu.edu.hk), and kindly copy Prof. Chung at [c.y.chung[at]polyu.edu.hk](mailto:c.y.chung@polyu.edu.hk) with their inquiries. To be eligible for consideration as a postdoctoral fellow or research associate, it is required that applicants have received a degree from a top 150 university/institute in the world or have a related field of study that is ranked within the top 150. However, exceptional candidates who have demonstrated outstanding research outputs may be considered for admission, regardless of their institutional affiliation. For applicants from Mainland China, graduation from a 985/211 university/institute is required.
